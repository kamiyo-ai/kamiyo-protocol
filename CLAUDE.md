## Communication Style

Write like an expert developer:
- No emojis
- No marketing language
- No verbose explanations
- No AI-sounding phrases
- Technical details only
- Concise responses

## Code Quality Standards

### Documentation
- Technical specifications, not marketing
- Code examples with actual implementation
- No phrases like "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge"
- No self-references or meta-commentary
- NO EMOJIS

### Commit Messages
- Imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Describe what and why, not how
- No emojis or decorative elements
- ALL commits must be by KAMIYO, dev@kamiyo.ai

### Code Comments and logs
- Explain why, not what
- Technical rationale only
- No obvious comments
