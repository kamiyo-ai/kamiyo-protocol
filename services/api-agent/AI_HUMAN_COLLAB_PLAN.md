# Exploit Intelligence Platform
## AI/Human Collaboration Revenue Plan (No Consulting)

**Project Start**: October 6, 2025
**Location**: ~/Projekter/exploit-intel-platform
**Model**: AI builds, Human guides/markets/sells
**Target**: $10K-$20K/month by Month 12

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE: AI DOES THE HEAVY LIFTING

### What AI (Claude) Can Build
1. ✅ **Exploit pattern database** (extract from historical data)
2. ✅ **Code scanners** (pattern matching, AST parsing)
3. ✅ **Risk scoring algorithms** (rule-based + ML)
4. ✅ **Automated reports** (structured output generation)
5. ✅ **Documentation** (technical writing, tutorials)
6. ✅ **Content creation** (blog posts, technical explanations)
7. ✅ **Data pipelines** (scraping, aggregating exploits)
8. ✅ **Web UI code** (frontend/backend implementation)

### What Human (You) Does
1. 👤 **Strategic decisions** (which ecosystem, what features)
2. 👤 **Marketing/sales** (write promotional copy, engage community)
3. 👤 **Customer conversations** (demos, feedback, support)
4. 👤 **Quality validation** ("Does this make sense?")
5. 👤 **Community management** (Discord, Twitter, GitHub)
6. 👤 **Business operations** (pricing, payments, legal)

### What We DON'T Do
❌ **Consulting** - Requires deep security expertise
❌ **Manual audits** - Requires expert knowledge
❌ **Custom security research** - Requires human expertise
❌ **Live incident response** - Requires real-time expertise

## WHAT MAKES THIS WORK WITHOUT CONSULTING

### Instead of Manual Consulting → Automated Tools

**Traditional consulting** (requires expertise):
- "Review this contract and find vulnerabilities"
- "Analyze this exploit and explain what happened"
- "Build custom security solution for our protocol"

**AI/Human automation** (no expertise needed):
- Tool runs automated scans (AI built it)
- Customers get reports (AI generated them)
- Human handles: "How do I use this?", "Can you add X feature?"

### Instead of Custom Research → Pre-Built Intelligence

**Traditional research** (requires expertise):
- "Investigate this novel attack vector"
- "Audit our custom contract design"
- "Analyze our specific threat model"

**AI/Human product** (no expertise needed):
- Historical exploit database (AI curated it)
- Pattern matching (AI automated it)
- Recommendations (AI generated them)
- Human handles: Delivery, demos, support

### Instead of Live Response → Monitoring & Alerts

**Traditional response** (requires expertise):
- "We got hacked, help us understand how"
- "Investigate suspicious transaction"
- "Emergency security review"

**AI/Human monitoring** (no expertise needed):
- Automated 24/7 scanning (AI built it)
- Instant alerts (AI sends them)
- Standard recommendations (AI provides them)
- Human handles: Setup, configuration, explanations

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. AI Prompt Engineering (Your Core Skill)

You need to get good at:
```
❌ Bad: "Build a scanner"
✅ Good: "Build a CosmWasm scanner that:
   - Excludes test files (patterns: **/test/**)
   - Checks for IBC replay vulnerabilities
   - Generates risk score 0-100
   - Outputs JSON with similar historical exploits
   - Has <50% false positive rate on Osmosis contracts"
```

### 2. Product Sense (Guide AI's work)

You decide:
- Which features matter (AI builds them)
- What users want (AI implements it)
- What to cut (AI removes it)
- What to charge (AI can't decide this)

### 3. Marketing Execution (Human touch required)

AI generates content, you:
- Post it authentically
- Engage with comments
- Build relationships
- Show personality

### 4. Quality Control (Human judgment)

AI builds fast, you ensure:
- It actually works
- Makes business sense
- Users will understand
- Pricing is right

## FINAL NOTE: WHY THIS WORKS

**You don't need to be a security expert because**:
1. AI builds the analysis tools
2. Tools rely on pattern matching (automated)
3. Historical data is factual (not opinion)
4. Users self-serve (tools, not consulting)
5. Support is product-focused (not security advice)

**You DO need to be**:
1. Good at prompting AI
2. Able to market/sell
3. Willing to engage community
4. Capable of basic quality control

**This is achievable** ✅

**Next action**: Start collaborating with AI to build Week 1 deliverables
