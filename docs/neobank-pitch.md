## Version 1: Public post

We're opening KAMIYO's trust infra to Solana neobanks.

Escrow, dispute resolution, ZK reputation, fraud prevention. Open source, built for card-based neobanks.

Escrow for agent work, freelance, P2P. Multi-oracle disputes - 75x faster than chargebacks, 88% cheaper. ZK proofs for card tier access without KYC. Shared blacklist across protocols. Settlement straight to cards.
