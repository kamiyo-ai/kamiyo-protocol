#### Content Templates for Week 1

**Post Type 1: Technical Insight**
```
Just implemented Token-2022 transfer fees on Solana.

Here's why it's game-changing for AI agent economies:

🧵 Thread [1/7]

1/ Traditional tokens can't capture value from transactions. With Token-2022's transfer fee extension, every KAMIYO transfer automatically splits:
- 1% to treasury (funds development)
- 1% to LP (ensures liquidity)

No external fee contracts needed.

2/ The magic is in the extension system...

[Continue with technical details]

Built with @solana Token-2022 standard.
Code: [GitHub link]

```

**Post Type 2: Build in Public Update**
```
Day 5 of building KAMIYO: The x402 payment facilitator

Today's progress:
✅ Implemented EVM payment verification
✅ Added Solana RPC integration
✅ Tested with real Base/Ethereum txs

Next up: Multi-chain bridge support

Building decentralized payments for AI agents 🤖💰

```

**Post Type 3: Problem/Solution**
```
AI agents need to pay for APIs, but Web2 payment rails don't work for them.

Credit cards? Agents can't get them.
Stripe? Requires KYC.
Crypto? Requires integration work.

We're solving this with x402 - a pay-per-request protocol using USDC.

Thread on how it works 👇
```

#### Week 1 Engagement Targets
- **Target accounts to reply to:**
  - @SolanaLegend, @therealchaseeb, @aeyakovenko (Solana core)
  - @shawmakesmagic, @swyx, @bentossell (AI/agent space)
  - @divine_economy, @luna_virtuals, @aixbt_agent (AI agent projects)
  - Search for tweets with "AI agents" "Solana" "crypto payments"

- **Quality reply formula:**
  1. Add unique insight or data point
  2. Share relevant experience
  3. Ask thoughtful follow-up question
  4. NO generic "great post!" or "agree!"

**Example Good Reply:**
```
Original tweet: "AI agents need better payment rails"

Your reply:
"We're seeing this exact problem with our x402 implementation.

87% of AI agent devs we surveyed said Web2 payment KYC is the #1 blocker.

Our solution: USDC micropayments with no signup. Agent sends 0.001 USDC → gets instant API access.

Would love to chat about your use case. DM open."

#### Content Focus: Thought Leadership

**Contrarian Takes (to spark discussion):**
```
Hot take: Most "AI agent tokens" will go to zero.

Why? They're solving the wrong problem.

Agents don't need governance tokens. They need payment rails.

KAMIYO isn't building another memecoin. We're building infrastructure.

Here's the difference 🧵
```

```
Unpopular opinion: Solana is better than Ethereum for AI agents.

Not because of speed or fees (though those matter).

But because of Token-2022's programmable transfer fees.

Let me explain why this matters for agent economies...
```

**Data-Driven Content:**
```
We analyzed 127 AI agent projects to understand their payment pain points.

Results:
- 89% need micropayments (<$1)
- 76% can't use Stripe (no legal entity)
- 64% want crypto but lack integration resources
- 52% abandon projects due to payment complexity

This is why we're building x402 👇
```

- Time it for Tuesday 10am ET (peak engagement)

**Strategy 2: Hot Take**
```
AI agents will flip the entire payment industry in 18 months.

Stripe, PayPal, Square - all at risk.

Not because agents are better. Because agents don't need their permission.

Here's why this changes everything 🧵

**Bad Reply:**
```
"Great post! 🔥"
```

**Good Reply:**
```
"This resonates. We're seeing the same thing with x402 - agents need sub-$1 payments without KYC.

Our approach: USDC micropayments with instant verification. No signup, no custody.

Have you considered [specific technical detail]? Would love to compare notes."
```

**Great Reply (adds unique value):**
```
"Exactly. We surveyed 127 AI agent devs and 89% cited payment integration as top blocker.

The issue isn't just technical - it's that Web2 payment rails assume human users with:
- Bank accounts
- Legal entities
- Long-term relationships

Agents need none of this. They need: send USDC → get access.

Solving this with x402 on Solana. Happy to share our research if useful."
```

**Key Principles:**
1. Add data or unique insight
2. Share relevant experience
3. Ask thoughtful follow-up
4. Offer value (research, code, intro)
5. Be generous, not salesy

### If You're Behind After Week 4 (Should be at 500, but only at 350)

**Aggressive Catch-Up Plan:**

1. **Content Blitz** (Week 5)
   - Post 4x daily instead of 2x
   - Ship 3 major threads in one week
   - Create 1 viral-worthy hot take

2. **Engagement Surge**
   - Reply to 100 accounts/day (up from 40)
   - Join 5 Twitter Spaces in one week
   - DM 20 potential collaborators

3. **Paid Acceleration** (optional)
   - Sponsor tweets from influencers ($50-200)
   - Twitter Ads to promote best thread ($100)
   - Pay for newsletter feature ($100-500)

4. **Giveaway** (if desperate)
   - "Follow + RT to win 10,000 KAMIYO tokens"
   - Requires having tokens ready
   - Gets followers fast but lower quality

**Warning:** Only use emergency tactics if truly needed. Organic growth is better quality.

## Red Flags & What to Avoid

### Don't Do This:
❌ **Follow/unfollow tactics** (looks desperate, gets you banned)
❌ **Buy followers** (fake accounts, kills engagement)
❌ **Spam replies** (generic "great post!" on everything)
❌ **Only talk about your project** (be a community member first)
❌ **Engage with scams/bots** (hurts your reputation)
❌ **Negative comments about competitors** (makes you look petty)
❌ **Too much promotion** (80% value, 20% promotion)

### Do This:
✅ **Be genuinely helpful** (answer questions, share knowledge)
✅ **Engage authentically** (real conversations, not scripted)
✅ **Give credit** (RT others, shout out inspirations)
✅ **Show your work** (build in public, be transparent)
✅ **Be consistent** (post daily, don't disappear for weeks)
✅ **Have a personality** (be human, not a corporate account)

**Fix:**
- Double down on what's working
- Cut what's not working
- Increase engagement to 60+ replies/day
- Try new content formats
- Seek 1-2 quick partnerships

### If You're Ahead (600+ Followers):
🚀 **Accelerate!**

**Opportunities:**

## Mindset & Motivation

### When Growth is Slow
- **Remember:** Organic growth is exponential, not linear
- **Week 1-3:** Feels like shouting into void (normal!)
- **Week 4-5:** Start seeing traction (keep going!)
- **Week 6-8:** Snowball effect kicks in (momentum builds)

### When You Want to Quit
- **Bad days are normal.** Not every tweet will hit.
- **Consistency beats intensity.** Daily small efforts > occasional big pushes.
- **Community > followers.** 100 engaged > 1000 silent.

### When You Feel Like an Imposter
- **You're building something real.** You have technical credibility.
- **Share what you're learning.** You don't need to be an expert.
- **Help others.** The best way to build authority is to be useful.

## FAQ

**Q: What if I don't have time for 90 min/day?**
A: Start with 30 min/day minimum. Post once, reply to 10 accounts. Quality > quantity.

**Q: Should I use Twitter Ads?**
A: Not yet. Organic first. Once you hit 500 followers, consider $100 test budget.

**Q: What if my tweets get no engagement?**
A: Keep going. First 100 followers are the hardest. Improve content, increase replies.

**Q: Should I focus on Twitter or build the product?**
A: Both. Spend 80% on product, 20% on community. This plan is the 20%.

**Q: When should I launch Discord?**
A: Week 3-4 (once you hit 300-500 followers). Not before.

**Q: Do I need to post every day?**
A: Yes. Minimum 1x daily. Ideally 2x. More than 4x = diminishing returns.

**Q: What if I'm not good at writing?**
A: Write like you talk. Be authentic. Technical content > polished marketing.

**Q: Should I hire a social media manager?**
A: Not yet. At 1K followers, it's still founder-led. Consider at 5K+.
