### Dual-Track Execution

**Track 1: Technical Development** (Main Plan)
- Orchestrator (Opus 4.1) delegates technical tasks
- Executors (Sonnet 4.5) build programs, backend, frontend
- Testing Agent ensures quality
- Production readiness checkpoints

**Track 2: Community Building** (Hype Addendum)
- Frontend Agent creates hype pages at milestones
- Marketing Agent (or human with AI assistance) posts to X
- Community engagement drives adoption
- Metrics tracked for iteration

**These tracks run in parallel:**
- While Solana Program Agent builds staking (Week 3-7), marketing prepares Devnet Launch content
- While Backend Agent integrates escrows (Week 8-10), marketing prepares Alignment Reveal
- Zero overhead - hype work happens during waiting periods

## 🤖 How to Execute

### Starting Development

**Simple Command:**
```
Start Phase 1 of KAMIYO token development
```

**What Happens:**
1. Orchestrator (Opus 4.1) reads `KAMIYO_TOKEN_MULTI_AGENT_PLAN.md`
2. Delegates tasks 1.1-1.4 to Research Agent (Sonnet 4.5) in parallel
3. Monitors progress and consolidates outputs (Task 1.5)
4. Generates Phase 1 Consolidation Report
5. Notifies you for production readiness review

**Your Role:**
- Review `docs/phase1/PHASE_1_CONSOLIDATION_REPORT.md`
- Review research documents (8 files)
- Approve or request revisions
- Make GO/NO-GO decision for Phase 2

### Executing Hype Milestones

**Command (after technical phase completes):**
```
Execute Hype Milestone 1: Vision Drop
```

**What Happens:**
1. Orchestrator delegates to Frontend Agent: Create coming soon page
2. Frontend Agent builds `/pages/kamiyo-token.js` with countdown, tokenomics, email signup
3. Marketing content generated from `KAMIYO_COMMUNITY_HYPE_ADDENDUM.md`
4. You review and approve X posts
5. You publish to X (or delegate to social media manager)

**Your Role:**
- Review frontend page (does it look good?)
- Review X post content (approve or edit)
- Publish posts at optimal time
- Monitor engagement metrics

### Parallel Execution (Efficient!)

You can run technical and hype tasks in parallel:

**Example (Week 7):**
```
Agent 1: Continue Phase 2 Task 2.6 (testing)
Agent 2: Execute Hype Milestone 2 (devnet launch frontend)
```

Both happen simultaneously, maximizing throughput.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### 1. Trust the Agents
- Agents have detailed prompts for every task
- Orchestrator validates outputs against success criteria
- Your job is strategic oversight, not micromanagement

### 2. Iterate at Checkpoints
- Don't wait until the end to give feedback
- Each checkpoint is an opportunity to adjust
- Use metrics to guide decisions (e.g., low engagement → revise messaging)

### 3. Parallel Hype Work
- While agents build technical features, prepare hype content
- Use waiting periods (e.g., tests running) to draft X posts
- Batch frontend reviews (review all 6 hype pages at once if preferred)

### 4. Engage Community Early
- Start building Discord/Telegram from Week 1
- Seed early adopters in Week 2 (Vision Drop)
- By Week 14 (Airdrop Hype), you should have 100+ engaged members

### 5. Document Everything
- Agents generate docs automatically (specs, reports, guides)
- Save all X threads as drafts (use Buffer/Hootsuite)
- Keep a launch journal (lessons learned for v1.1)

### 6. Prepare for Launch Chaos
- Week 19 is intense (72-hour monitoring)
- Have support ready (Discord mods, FAQ bot)
- Test everything on devnet first (no surprises on mainnet)
