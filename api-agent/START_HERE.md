# START HERE 👋
## Your AI/Human Collaboration Begins Now

**Project**: Exploit Intelligence Platform
**Location**: `~/Projekter/exploit-intel-platform`
**Date**: October 6, 2025

---

## What Just Happened

✅ **Project created** in ~/Projekter/exploit-intel-platform
✅ **All assets moved** from experiment (intelligence data, tools, strategy docs)
✅ **Plan revised** to exclude consulting (pure AI/human collab)
✅ **Git initialized** with 2 commits, 93 files

---

## Revised Strategy (NO CONSULTING)

### What Changed
❌ **Removed**: Consulting revenue stream (requires security expertise you don't have)
✅ **Added**: Pure AI-built tools + human marketing/sales

### New Revenue Targets

**Month 3**: $800-$2,000/month
- Researcher tool: 5-15 users @ $49/month
- Protocol monitoring: 1-3 protocols @ $300/month
- Course sales: 2-5 students @ $200

**Month 6**: $3,000-$6,000/month
- Researcher tool: 15-30 users
- Protocol monitoring: 3-6 protocols
- Course: 5-10 students
- Grant: Maybe approved

**Month 12**: $10,000-$20,000/month
- Researcher tool: 30-50 users @ $59/month
- Protocol monitoring: 10-20 protocols @ $400/month
- Educational content: Ongoing
- Grants: 1-2 active

### How It Works

**AI (Claude) builds**:
- All code (scanners, tools, dashboards)
- All content (blogs, docs, course materials)
- All automation (monitoring, alerts, reports)

**You (Human) do**:
- Strategic decisions (what to build, pricing)
- Marketing (Twitter, Discord, community)
- Sales (demos, conversations, closing)
- Quality control ("Does this make sense?")

**You DON'T need**:
- Security expertise
- Auditing skills
- Technical deep dives
- Consulting capabilities

## What You Have Right Now

### 1. Exploit Intelligence Database
```bash
cat intelligence/database/exploit_database.json
# 10 major exploits, $2.8B in losses
# Patterns: reentrancy, oracle, access control, flash loan, bridge
```

### 2. Pattern Matching Engine
```bash
cat intelligence/patterns/code_patterns.json
# 5 attack patterns with regex matching
# Links patterns → historical exploits
```

### 3. Protocol Scanner (Working!)
```bash
python3 pivot-tools/build_protocol_scanner.py
# Scans: Aave V3, Uniswap V3, Compound V3
# Output: Risk scores, pattern matches, recommendations
```

### 4. Strategy Documents
- `AI_HUMAN_COLLAB_PLAN.md` - Complete strategy
- `REALISTIC_REVENUE_PATH.md` - 12-month roadmap
- `THIS_WEEK_ACTION_PLAN.md` - Week 1 tasks
- `MONTH_3_EXPECTATIONS.md` - 3-month targets
- `BRUTAL_REALITY_CHECK.md` - Why we pivoted

## How To Collaborate With AI (Me)

### Good Prompts ✅

```
"Build a CosmWasm scanner that excludes test files
and checks for IBC replay vulnerabilities. Output
JSON with risk score and similar historical exploits."
```

```
"Write a blog post titled 'Why Static Analysis Failed'
explaining our experiment, the 100% FP rate, and pivot
to post-deployment intelligence. 1,800 words, include
data from BRUTAL_REALITY_CHECK.md."
```

```
"Generate a Cosmos grant proposal requesting $100K
over 6 months to build security intelligence platform.
Include budget breakdown and technical approach."
```

### Bad Prompts ❌

```
"Build something cool" (too vague)
"Make it better" (no specifics)
"Fix the bug" (which bug?)
```

### Collaboration Pattern

**You**: "Build X with these requirements..."
**AI**: [Builds it]
**You**: "Test... it's flagging Y incorrectly, fix"
**AI**: [Fixes]
**You**: "Test again... works! Now add Z feature"
**AI**: [Adds feature]
**You**: "Ship it"

## Common Questions

### "What if I don't understand the technical details?"
**You don't need to.** AI builds the tech, you just need to:
- Know if it works (test it)
- Explain it simply to customers (I'll help)
- Guide what to build next (business decisions)

### "What if someone asks deep security questions?"
**Don't answer.** Say:
- "The tool provides automated pattern matching against historical exploits"
- "For deep security analysis, consult with an audit firm"
- "Our focus is intelligence, not consulting"

### "What if the grant gets rejected?"
**Plan B**:
- Focus on SaaS (can still hit $3K-$6K by Month 6)
- Apply to Aptos/Sui grants
- Double down on educational content
- Community building for credibility

### "What if no one pays?"
**Validate fast**:
- By Week 4, you'll know if people are interested
- By Month 2, you'll have first paying customers or not
- If not: Pivot to different ecosystem or model
- Total sunk cost: 60 hours (acceptable learning)
