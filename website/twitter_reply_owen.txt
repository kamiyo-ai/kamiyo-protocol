Great conversation. One critical gap in perps infrastructure: real-time exploit intelligence.

We track 54 chains for exploit patterns. Perps protocols get hit with oracle manipulation, flash loan attacks, and funding rate exploits regularly.

Tradfi has circuit breakers. DeFi needs exploit monitoring built into the stack from day one.

kamiyo.ai aggregates from 20+ sources - built specifically for protocol teams who need to know when similar protocols get exploited.
