## Title

Add priority fee docs

## Description

Docs for `getPriorityFeeEstimate` - API format, fee levels, retry strategies, cost calculation.

Covers:
- Request/response format
- When to use each fee level
- Adding fees to transactions
- Retry with escalation
- Account-specific queries

The API exists but there's no guide on how to actually use it in practice.
